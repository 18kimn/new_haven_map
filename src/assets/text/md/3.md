Our next map challenges the bounds of the map even further. While a traditional map functions by adding context to geographic features and their position in space, this map removes context from features and even makes them almost unrecognizable by moving them into a grid arranged by size. In doing so, we highlight the message hinted at by our original property map: though Yale owns a significant number of properties and land area in New Haven, New Haven still dwarfs Yale in terms of the number of properties, the people that inhabit them, and land area.

In other words, while Yale’s material stake in New Haven is important and consequential, it derives its importance from improvements over the land that are ascribed value through social constructions. This many-pronged dominance of property in New Haven — not only material or physical, but also cultural and ideological in a single tightly integrated grip — motivates us to characterize Yale’s position as hegemonic.
